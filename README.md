# LoveRelay
A website to help students to finish their education by raising money from public.
People can put their money by different ways and this website will record the money income/outcome in every detail.
Once a student finishs his education and gees to work, he will return the money to LoveRelay, then other students are possible to use the same money. 
The money are being transfered like relay batons and love lasts forever.
We trace how each amount of money is collected and used by which student. 
Students who want to get help must abandon their rights of privacy as the information of money users are completely transparent.
